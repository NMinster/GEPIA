# GEPIA
Analysis of gene signatures using GEPIA python API and machine learning

This analysis includes the following steps: 

1. Analysis for Overall survival of published breast cancer gene signature sets. 
2. Further analysis of the genes as a group. 
3. Identification of the most important genes in terms of overall survival. 
4. Building a new gene signature from these genes using interpretable machine learning and assessing the overall survival.
